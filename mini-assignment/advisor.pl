% rules 6 & 7
% The next rule uses cut !. The order of the following
% 2 clauses is important. The second one only fires if 
% the first one fails. Does not allow backtracking. 
% Cut ! prevents this.

income(adequate) :-

	dependents(Y),
	minincome(Y, MI),
	X > MI, !.

income(inadequate).

minsavings(Y, I) :- 
	I is 5000 * Y.
	
minincome(D, I) :-
	I is 15000 + D * 4000.
